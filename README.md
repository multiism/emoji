Right now this is a simple emoji *generator*,
which you can [try out here][app].

The goal is a semantically branching emoji picker,
where you can drill down to increasingly nuanced expressions.
With options for hats and such, probably,
which would bring it into "designer" territory.

You should be able to find an emoji faster than
just scrolling through rows and rows in a list,
and find ones that really fit what you want to express,
be it silly or serious.
(Or seriously silly.)
